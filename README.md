Fun little skill that allows you to create a small movie DB for picking random movies when your kids can't decide what to watch.

# The Story
In my house we have a candy bowl in the livingroom with a bunch of movie titles written on a scraps of paper. They are all family friendly so when Friday night comes around and we have nothing to do but watch a moive one of the kids will grab a random scrap of paper and that will be the movie we watch that night. 

If every one disagrees we will pick again but the rule is if one kid says yes thats it no more picks and pop some corn and chill out. 

When I got the Echo I want to write a fun skill so I coded up this simple skill to replace the bowl of scrap paper with the Echo and it worked great and was fun for the kids. If you kids are a little older this could be a fun coding project as well.
